# The Guest Spot

A Discourse plugin that transforms your forum into a dual-purpose platform for tattoo artists: a public Instagram-style showcase combined with a private, invite-only community.

## What is The Guest Spot?

**Public side:** Artists share their work in a beautiful feed with portfolio pages. Anyone can view and engage.

**Private side:** Invite-only forum for shop talk, technique sharing, and industry discussions.

The name comes from tattoo culture - a "guest spot" is when a traveling artist works at another shop. It captures the collaborative, welcoming spirit we're building here.

## Status

ðŸš§ **Early Design Phase** - Currently documenting requirements and planning architecture. Not ready for installation yet.

See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for the complete design document.

## Key Features (Planned)

- **Public feed** with pinned carousel and recent grid
- **Artist portfolios** showcasing their best work
- **Invite tree system** (lobste.rs style) for quality curation

## Tech Stack
